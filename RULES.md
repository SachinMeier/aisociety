# HIGH SOCIETY
MONEY ISN’T EVERYTHING
A Game by Reiner Knizia
A cunning card game for 3-5 players.
_________________________________________________________________________
## GAME CONTENTS
• 55 Money Cards of varying denominations. 5 sets in different colours, 11 cards per set.
• 16 Status Cards, some more desirable than others:
The 10 Possession Cards improve their owner's lifestyle.
The 3 Title Cards magnify their owner's prestige.
The 3 Misfortune Cards have negative consequences, and should be avoided.
High Society is about gaining status. Use your assets wisely to succeed. Remember: Money
isn't everything - but it helps.

## OVERVIEW
By playing money cards, players bid to get Possession and Title cards and to avoid
Misfortune cards. As long as a player has not passed in a round, he can increase his bid by
adding more money cards to outbid the others. A round of bidding is over when all players
but one have passed. In the end, the player with the highest status, and who has more money
than at least one other player, wins the game.

## MONEY CARDS
One set of eleven money cards consists of one each of: 25,000, 20,000, 15,000, 12,000,
10,000, 8,000, 6,000, 4,000, 3,000, 2,000 and 1,000. Players use money to bid for Possession
and Title cards, and to avoid Misfortune cards.
STATUS CARDS
Possession Cards
These are the cards that really count. They show status values from 1-10, thereby increasing
the prestige of their owner.
Title Cards
Each Title card doubles the value of its bearer's Possession cards.
Misfortune Cards
• The Scandal card halves the value of its bearer's Possession cards.
• The Gambling Debt card reduces the total value of its bearer's Possession cards by 5.
• The player who gets the Theft card must discard one of his Possession cards. If he does
not yet own a Possession card, he must discard the first one he gets. The Theft card must
be discarded with this Possession card.

## PREPARATION
Each player is given the set of eleven money cards in one colour to form a hand. Shuffle the
sixteen Status cards and place the deck face down in the middle of the table. Choose a starting
player for the first round. There will be at most fifteen rounds.
## THE GAME BEGINS
The starting player turns up the top Status card - the card that will go to the highest bidder for
this round. Beginning with the starting player, and proceeding clockwise, each player may
take a turn. A player's turn consists of taking one of two actions:
### 1 - Play Money Cards
A player may play one or more money cards from his hand. The cards are placed face up in
front of him. The total value of all his open money cards should be announced out loud.
As long as bids increase play continues clockwise around the table. In this way, one player
may make several bids. The total value announced must always increase. A player who
increases his bid must not withdraw any of the previously played open money cards. He may
only add to his layout - no changing is allowed.
If a player does not make a bid, he must pass.
### 2 - Pass
The player whose turn it is may pass. When passing, the player takes all his open money cards
back into his hand, and he is excluded from making further bids in this round.
END OF THE ROUND
Possession and Title Cards
After all but one of the players have passed, the remaining bidder takes the Possession or Title
card and displays it face up in front of him on the table. The bid is paid for by placing his
open money cards onto a discard pile (they are out of the game). If all of the players pass
without ever bidding, the last player who had the option of bidding gets the card for free.
Misfortune Cards
Here things are the other way around. Now the first player who passes gets the card and
places it face up in front of him. If the player bid money cards before passing, he may return
these into his hand. The other players must place their bids on the discard pile.
## NEW ROUND
The player who received the previous Status card is the starting player for the next round and
turns over another Status card from the deck. Play then proceeds as before.
## END OF THE GAME
Four out of the sixteen Status cards have red edges (the three Title cards and the Scandal
card). The game ends immediately when the fourth red-edged card is turned face up. This card
and the remainder of the face-down deck do not count toward any player's score.
### WHO IS 'OUT'?
Each player totals the money remaining in his hand. The player (or players) with the least
money is out and loses the game right away.
### WHO IS 'IN'?
Only the remaining players have a chance of winning. They total the values of their
Possession cards. If a player has the Gambling Debt card he must subtract 5 from his total.
Then, for each Title card held, a player doubles the total value of his cards; if the Scandal card
is held, this halves the total value of his cards.

For example, a player totals his cards as follows:
Possession(s): Racehorse [+3], Chateau [+9] = 12
Misfortune: Gambling Debt [-5] = 7
Title: First [x2] = 14
Title: Second [x2] = 28
Misfortune: Scandal [x½] = 14
TOTAL STATUS 14
### THE WINNER
The player with the highest result has the most status and wins the game. Congratulations! In
the case of a tie, the player with more money in his hand wins. If there is still a tie, then all
tied players win.

## HINTS FOR SUCCESS
1. Do not waste your money. The poorest player always loses.
2. Do not hesitate to pass if the bid goes too high. Be patient and wait for your chance.
3. Keep an eye on your remaining money card distribution - no change is given!
4. Try to remember which money cards your opponents have already used up, to gauge your
relative strengths.
5. Do not forget you will need some money cards to defend yourself against Misfortune.
6. Look over the Status cards that are already distributed to determine which are still
outstanding.
7. Always be prepared for the quick finish: the Scandal card may not necessarily be
distributed.
8. Take the measure of your opponents: how willing are they to take a risk, and how well do
they bluff?
9. Stay cool until the end - do not show any nerves!
